# CycloRoute black

These values are set differently than the original.
  <renderingConstant name="defaultColorNight" value="#000000"/>
  <renderingConstant name="shaderColorNight" value="#000000"/>
  <renderingConstant name="builtUpAreasColorNight" value="#000000"/>

Download CycloRoute.render.xml and open with Osmand to import (should appear automatically as an option).

To enjoy full blackness, tick "Hide Areas" option<br>
Reduced my battery use on an OLED phone by a few percent compared to the normal Cylosm night theme.
