# CycloRoute black

The values: defaultColorNight, shaderColorNight, builtUpAreasColorNight are set to #000000

Download CycloRoute.render.xml and open with Osmand to import (should appear automatically as an option).

For more blackness, tick "Hide Areas" option<br>
Reduced my battery use on an OLED phone by a few percent compared to the normal Cylosm night theme.
